# DEPRECATED
## rebass now supports emotion so this package isn't necessary
# rebass-emotion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emotion-js/rebass-emotion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emotion-js/rebass-emotion)

> Functional React UI component library

rebass-emotion is a wrapper around [rebass](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass) that uses [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) instead of [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

All of the components in rebass-emotion are explained in [rebass's README](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass#readme) and [its site](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/).

## Thanks

Thanks to [Brent Jackson](https://github.com/jxnblk) who built rebass. ❤️
